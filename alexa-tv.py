""" alexa_tv.py - https://github.com/efpe/

    The idea and some part of the code came from https://github.com/toddmedema/echo
    This will register itself to Alexa as 'tv'.

    You can use "Alexa, turn on TV" or "Alexa turn off TV".

    For the ON event it sends a magic packet to the specified MAC address
    For the OFF event it calls the NodeJS script which calls the WebOS API and turns of the TV.
